            The criminal justice system can't support safe, whole communities
            without feedback on what’s working and what’s not. We stitch
            together data from fragmented systems to provide decision-makers
            with the information they need to improve outcomes. With this data,
            we surface opportunities to safely chart a path to a smaller system,
            and to track the impact of policy and practice changes over time.
